# React-Fake Store API

In this project we will be building shopping app using React.js. We will be using the Fake Store API to create the application. 
We will use React Hooks such as :
- useState
- useEffect
- axios library to fetch the data from the API.
At the end we will have a fantastic application which will show a page with product images and information about them  !
