# React-Fake Store API

In this project I had built shopping app using React.js. I used the Fake Store API to create the application. 
I used React Hooks such as :
- useState
- useEffect
- axios library to fetch the data from the API.
At the end we will have a fantastic application which will show a page with product images and information about them  !
